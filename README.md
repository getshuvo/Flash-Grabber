What is this?
=============

After playing the youtube video in your browse, you might wanted to save that video. But where is it? Not a clue?
It's where this script shows it's magic. It's a simple linux bash script to grab those flash files.

How to use?
-------

* Download the `fla.sh` file and place it anywhere (home directory will be good)
* Make it executable by this command - `chmod +x fla.sh`
* Now it's time to grab those files
* Just run this file like this `./fla.sh` and it'll do the rest
* This script will get those videos and will save them to your home directory by giving some random file name

I am not a pro in bash scripting. You may contribute by improving it in some(!) ways
